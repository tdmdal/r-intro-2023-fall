R is extensible, and has a large collection of high-quality user contributed packages that provides easy tools for common data analysis tasks. This 4-session workshop will introduce you the fundamentals of R programming.\n\n\nWhat To Prepare\nPlease install R and RStudio Desktop before the first session.\nIf you encounter technical difficulties installing the software, you can instead create a free RStudio Cloud account so you can run R in the cloud via your browser.\nAn alternative to RStudio Cloud is the UofT JupyterHub/RStudio system. Go to its home page, choose the RStudio option, and click Log in to start. You will need your UTORid to login.\n\n\n\nSession 1, 2\n\nSlides\nCode\n\nWeighted dice (We will code this one together.)\nR basic data structures (R Notebook )\nR basic programming structures (R Notebook )\n\nReading list\n\nYour Textbook (Section 2.3 Lab: Introduction to R)\nHands-on Programming with R (Chapter 1 to 3; Chapter 4 to 7, 9 and 11)\n\n\n\n\nSession 3\n   Coming soon.\n\n\nSession 4\n   Coming soon.\n\n\n\nResources\n\nFrom Zero to Hero\n\nStep 1: Hands-on Programming with R (beginner level; learn R programming basics.)\nStep 2: R for Data Science (intermediate level; learn to manipulate, analyze and visualize data using R’s Tidyverse packages.)\nStep 3: Advanced R (advanced level; learn to master R.)\n\nOther Resources\n\nR for Reproducible Scientific Analysis (from software carpentry)\nProgramming with R (from software carpentry)\nR Graphics Cookbook\nggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis\nThe R Graph Gallery (R graph samples with code)\nR Cheat Sheets (cheat sheets for many popular R packages)\nDoSStoolkit (self-paced interactive modules to help you learn and use R from Uoft Dept. of Statistical Science)\n\n\n\nBack to TDMDAL Computing Page"
