title: "R Intro (Fall 2023)"
---

R is an open-source programming language for statistical computing and graphics. R is extensible, and has a large collection of high-quality user contributed packages that provides easy tools for common data analysis tasks. This 4-session workshop will introduce you the fundamentals of R programming.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### What To Prepare

Please install [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [RStudio Desktop](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) before the first session.

If you encounter technical difficulties installing the software, you can instead create a free [RStudio Cloud](https://rstudio.cloud/) account so you can run R in the cloud via your browser.

An alternative to RStudio Cloud is the UofT JupyterHub/RStudio system. Go to its [home page](https://jupyter.utoronto.ca/hub/login), choose the *RStudio* option, and click *Log in to start*. You will need your UTORid to login.
